## Drivers & Abstraction

Drivers are a massive topic in embedded systems, and writing them from scratch can be quite complex. For this project, we wonâ€™t be writing drivers ourselvesâ€”instead, we will be using the drivers provided by ESP-IDF, which abstract us away from the hardware.

For example, in `main.c` you might see:

uart_write_bytes(RYLR998_UART_PORT, at_command, strlen(at_command));

This function does not directly manipulate the UART hardware to send bits. Instead, it calls into the ESP-IDF UART driver. If you trace it, youâ€™ll find the implementation in:

esp-idf/components/driver/uart


Inside uart.c, uart_write_bytes() eventually calls lower-level functions such as uart_tx_all(). These contain all the complexity of handling FIFOs, interrupts, DMA, and error conditions. 
While we are not expected to fully understand this code, itâ€™s valuable to recognize the effort that goes into writing such driversâ€”and to appreciate the abstraction layers provided to us.

In practice, we will make use of top-level abstractions like uart_write_bytes() to interact with hardware. This is much easier and safer than directly manipulating registers (e.g., GPIO->MODER |= â€¦).

Other microcontroller ecosystems provide similar abstractions:

STM32: HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

TI MSP430: DriverLib

Nordic nRF52: nRF5 SDK drivers

These abstractions save time, improve readability, and help ensure portability across projects.
